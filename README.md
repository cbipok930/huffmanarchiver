# huffman
Program works through Huffman.bat at prog's root dir(Windows), or you can "stack exec", "stack run"

You can compress file with "zip" and decode it with "unzip" in case of program asks you(just type it in command line)

Then program asks for file what it must transform (type file name/path)

After you should indecate name of file, what program creates

*Program doesn't delete input file
*It works with files in program's root directory by default(if you don't type paths)# huffmanarchiver
